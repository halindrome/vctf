          <h3 id="welcome">Welcome to the Verifiable Claims Task Force</h3>
<p>
The goal of this task force is to determine if a W3C Working Group should be 
created to standardize technology around a verifiable claims ecosystem 
(aka: credentials, attestations). 
</p>

<p>
The Task Force is actively engaging a diverse set of 
participants<sup>1</sup> in a neutral group to discuss use cases 
(such as enrollment) and the problem area in general. The group is documenting 
and analyzing concerns raised in various fora around the value-add that W3C 
could provide around verifiable claims that are user-centric.
</p>

<p>
<sup id="super-1">1</sup> <em>Participants are expected to be invited from organizations like W3C, IETF, IMS Global, claims issuers, identity providers, claims consumers, the Credentials CG, the general public, and a variety of other organizations and individuals that have shown interest in the space.</em>
</p>

          <h3 id="telecons">Weekly Telecons</h3>
    <p>
The group meets regularly on Tuesdays at 11am ET. A typical meeting will have 
an agenda that is posted to the 
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments-ig/latest">mailing list</a> 
at least 24 hours prior to the call. There are no costs associated with joining 
the group or limitations on who may join the teleconference as long as they 
agree to contribute productively to the discussion.

Make sure you have a good headset with a microphone as any background noise 
is distracting to others during the call. If there is excessive noise on your 
connection, you will be muted until you need to speak. If you cannot get SIP 
to work for you, there is an emergency dial-in number. If you use this number 
regularly, you will be expected to reimburse the group for call charges. 
SIP is free for both the caller and the callee - use it. Emergency dial-in 
number: <a href="tel:+15409614469;postd=p6306">+1.540.961.4469 x6306</a>
